# EvoGym Learning Alphabet
**Letter-shaped soft robots** in [Evolution Gym (EvoGym)](https://evolutiongym.github.io/), a benchmark and simulator for **co-optimizing robot design and control**.

A genetic algorithm is used for design optimization, where robot morphologies or controller parameters are evolved over generations using variation (mutation/crossover) and selection based on performance.

Reinforcement learning (PPO) is used for controller training, where policies are learned through repeated interaction with the EvoGym environment.
